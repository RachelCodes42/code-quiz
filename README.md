# <Code Quiz>

## Description

The Coding Quiz is a web application developed for any coders to assess their JavaScript knowledge through a timed quiz. It offers a user-friendly interface and features a high score functionality for comparing progress with peers. The quiz was created to motivate peers to improve their skills in a competitive and engaging environment. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application presents questions one by one, deducts time for incorrect answers, and allows users to save their scores. The Coding Quiz aims to support colleagues in their learning journey and foster healthy competition among peers.

Thank you for using the Coding Quiz! I value your feedback and suggestions.

## Installation

To use the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click the "Start" button to begin the quiz.
Answer each question by selecting the correct option.
If your answer is incorrect, time will be deducted from the timer.

You can view the high scores by clicking the "High Scores" button on the home page.

## Usage

Clicking the "Start" button initiates the quiz and starts a timer.
Each question is presented one at a time.
Correct answers lead to the next question, while incorrect answers deduct time from the timer.
When the timer reaches zero or all questions are answered, the quiz ends.
At the end of the quiz, users can save their initials and score.
Users can view high scores to compare their progress with others.
